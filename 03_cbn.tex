A copula bayesian networks (CBN), as defined by G. Elidan
\cite{cbn_elidan_2010}, is a triplet $\left(\mathcal{G}, \theta_C,
\theta_F\right)$ where $\mathcal{G}$ is directed acyclic graph
(DAG), $\theta_C$ a set of copulas and $\theta_F$ a set of marginals.
As in bayesian networks, a CBN encodes the conditional independencies
of a multivariate probability distribution.
